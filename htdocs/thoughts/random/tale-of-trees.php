        People often compare to boring things to "watching the grass grow."
        I think that people who say this don't spend enough time gardening.
        Last fall I grabbed a handful of acorns while hiking in the San Diego mountains and potted them.
        Just last week they started sprouting and it is really exciting to see these little guys get going!
        When they get big enough I'm going to plant them in the open space near my condo.

        It's been a rough few months.
        The world is getting turned upside down, for better or for worse, and yet life goes on.

        <p>
        I planted my trees two months ago.
        Four of the acorns sprouted and I transplanted all of them.
        Since then one has died.
        This was the first to sprout and the biggest when it croaked.
        </p>
        <p>
        The biggest surprise, however, was the smallest and last tree I planted.
        In the first few days a ground squirrel burrowed up underneath it.
        Then, if that wasn't enough, something clipped off its leaves, leaving a barren stem.
        I thought this one was a lost cause.
        Yet, in a heroic comeback, this last week it has 9 new leaves!
