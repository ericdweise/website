        This page was inspired when I listened to Derek Sivers's interview with Tim Ferriss 
        <a href="https://tim.blog/2015/12/14/derek-sivers-on-developing-confidence-finding-happiness-and-saying-no-to-millions/">(interview number 125)</a>.
        I thought this is not only a great way to tell people what I'm working on but also to remind myself what's important.
        So, I am joining the <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">NowNowNow</a> movement.
        <h2>Where I Call Home</h2>
        San Diego, CA
        <h2>What I'm working on</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Pursuing a master's in Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Applied Physics at UC San Diego.
	    <li> Training for a triathlon.
		I hoped to do a sign up for my first tri at the end of June,
		but the current crisis changed that plan.
		So, I'm going to do an un-official tri sometime over the summer.
		Hopefully the pools open up soon,
		otherwise I'll have to learn how to swim in the ocean without a surfboard.
	    <li> Starting a software development consulting business.
		This has been on hold since I started my master's program,
		but I already made business cards so there's no turning back now.
            <li> Being more grounded in nature.
                I haven't been backpacking in over a year and I feel like I'm starting to forget what it is like to be wholly immersed in wilderness.
                I'm tentatively planning 3 backpacking trips in the next few months.
                Check out my <a href="/adventures/">adventures</a> as I write about them.
        </ul>
        <h2>What I'm reading</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> <em>All These Shiny Worlds</em>, the 2016 ImerseOrDie anthology
            <li> <em>Perfectly Reasonable Deviations (From the Beaten Track)</em> by Richard Feynman
            <li> <em>The Hard Thing About Hard Things</em> by Ben Horowitz
            <li> <em>The Four Hour Work Week</em> by Tim Ferriss
            <li> <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</em> by Mark Manson
        </ul>
        <h2>What I'm Listening To</h2>
        <p>
        Normally when I'm in a <em>get stuff done</em> mood I turn to fast, distorted music like
        <a href="https://youtu.be/sAsMUXuBeB8?t=20">Angel Vivaldi</a>.
        I feel like fast cadence channels into fast work.
        Recently, however, I've been listening to slower music.
        I find that it gives me a lot of focused and sustained energy.
        Two playlists that I've been playing pretty much nonstop are
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY3cAFsquIk7VGMuk-V8S3g/featured">Meute</a> and 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/rpoland">Candyrat Records</a>.
